# PLY Compiler

To execute this program, run
```python3 .\plytac.py```

The program takes its input from the file ```input.txt```.
The 3AC output is generated into the file ```output.txt```.

**Special considerations**

 - Since it was an optional feature, `print` statements are not supported.
 - Only int2float convertions are implicit, num2string has to be made explicit by surrounding the expresion with `string( )`
 - Operator precedence is followed
 - Some operations are simplified when converted to 3AC
